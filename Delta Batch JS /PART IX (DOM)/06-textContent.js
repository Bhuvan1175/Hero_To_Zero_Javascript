// innerHTML allows you to set or get the HTML markup inside an element, including HTML tags.

// textContent sets or gets the text content of an element, ignoring HTML tags and rendering the text as plain text.

// innerText is similar to textContent but also respects CSS styles like display: none and can cause reflow when used, while textContent does not.
