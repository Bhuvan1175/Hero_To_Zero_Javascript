The for...in loop in JavaScript is used for iterating over the properties of an object. It iterates over the enumerable properties (including inherited ones) of an object, providing access to the property names (keys). It's important to note that for...in should not be used to iterate over arrays, as it might not behave as expected due to the possibility of iterating over prototype properties.
